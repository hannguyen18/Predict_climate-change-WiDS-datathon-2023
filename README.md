# Predict climate change WiDS datathon 2023

The Datathon topic is Adapting to Climate Change by Improving Extreme Weather Forecasts. My task was to use data science to improve longer-range weather forecasts to help people prepare and adapt to extreme weather events caused by climate change. The prediction task involved forecasting sub-seasonal temperatures within the United States. A pre-prepared dataset for participants consisted of weather and climate information for several US locations, some start dates for the two-week observation, and the forecasted temperature and precipitation from several weather forecast models. Primarily, my task was to predict the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum temperature over the next 14 days for each location and start date.

My solution entailed utilizing machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Multi-layer Perceptron Regressor (MLPRegressor) to achieve this. Ultimately, I got 98% accuracy with MLPRegressor.
